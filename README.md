# 🤖 2027 Robot Code - Ri3D Big Sky Robotics 🤖
Code for Big Sky Robotics Team from Montana State University ⛰️
## Features
### [State Machines](https://github.com/Montana-State-Ri3D/2026-Ri3D/tree/master/src/main/java/frc/robot/stateMachines)
#### [SuperStructure](https://github.com/Montana-State-Ri3D/2026-Ri3D/blob/master/src/main/java/frc/robot/subsystems/SuperStructure.java)
Finite State Machine for positions and velocities of all mechanisms. Numbers are tunable for quick testing.
#### [SuperStateMachine](https://github.com/Montana-State-Ri3D/2026-Ri3D/blob/master/src/main/java/frc/robot/stateMachines/SuperStateMachine.java)
Finite State Machine for robot game action (intaking, scoring, climbing, ect.). Calls action state machines, such as [ScoreStateMachine](https://github.com/Montana-State-Ri3D/2026-Ri3D/blob/master/src/main/java/frc/robot/stateMachines/ScoreStateMachine.java), or directly sets SuperStructure states
#### Action State Machines
Sequential state machines to handle compound actions cleanly while logging current state. Uses 2930 State Machine library. Includes [ScoreStateMachine](https://github.com/Montana-State-Ri3D/2026-Ri3D/blob/master/src/main/java/frc/robot/stateMachines/ScoreStateMachine.java) and [IntakeStateMachine](https://github.com/Montana-State-Ri3D/2026-Ri3D/blob/master/src/main/java/frc/robot/stateMachines/IntakeStateMachine.java).
Example: When scoring, robot prepares by spinning up RPM and rotating to the hub, then when those conditions are met, indexes gamepieces to the flywheel.
### [Drivetrain](https://github.com/Montana-State-Ri3D/2026-Ri3D/tree/master/src/main/java/frc/robot/subsystems/drive)
- State-based control (controller, path follow, drive to pose, rotate to angle)
- choreo path following
- Mecanum drive
### [Autonomous](https://github.com/Montana-State-Ri3D/2026-Ri3D/tree/master/src/main/java/frc/robot/autonomous)
- [Auto Manager](https://github.com/Montana-State-Ri3D/2026-Ri3D/blob/master/src/main/java/frc/robot/autonomous/AutoManager.java) to create sendable chooser for paths
- [AutoStateMachine](https://github.com/Montana-State-Ri3D/2026-Ri3D/blob/master/src/main/java/frc/robot/autonomous/AutoStateMachine.java) to handle all auto logic
